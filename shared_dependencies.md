The shared dependencies between the files we are generating are:

1. **Next.js**: This is the main framework used for building the application. It is used in all the files for server-side rendering and routing.

2. **React**: Next.js is built on top of React, so React components and hooks are used throughout the application.

3. **TypeScript**: TypeScript is used in all the .tsx files for type checking and improved developer experience.

4. **React-DOM**: This is used in _document.tsx for server-side rendering of the React components.

5. **CSS Modules**: CSS Modules are used in the .css files for styling the components.

6. **Common Components**: The Header.tsx and Footer.tsx components are likely used in multiple pages of the application.

7. **Common Styles**: The globals.css file likely contains styles that are used across multiple components and pages.

8. **Public Assets**: The favicon.ico and vercel.svg files in the public directory are likely used across multiple pages of the application.

9. **Package.json**: This file contains the list of project dependencies and scripts, which are shared across the entire project.

10. **tsconfig.json**: This file contains the TypeScript configuration options which are shared across all TypeScript files in the project.

11. **.next/config.js**: This file contains the configuration for the Next.js application, which is shared across the entire project.
